"firstPost.author" = "Antilles (also Caribbean or Caribbean Islands)";

Together they form an area of 228,662 square kilometers with a population of approximately 42 million (at the beginning of the 21st century). The name \"Antilles\" first occurs in 1493 by Peter Martyr d'Anguiere, a contemporary of Christopher Columbus, courtier to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Presumably, they were named after the semi-mythical island or archipelago of Antilia, depicted on medieval maps.";

"secondPost.author" = "The urbis, or snow bar";
"secondPost.description" = "The urbis, or snow leopard, or snow leopard (Latin: Panthera uncia, formerly Latin: Uncia uncia) is a large predatory mammal of the feline family that inhabits the mountains of Central Asia. The irbis is distinguished by its thin, long, flexible body, relatively short legs, small head and very long tail. Together with the tail, it reaches a length of 200-230 cm and weighs up to 55 kg. The fur coloration is light smoky-gray, with ring-shaped and solid dark spots. Nowadays the number of irbis is catastrophically low - the population of the species in 2003 according to different estimations was from 4 to 7 thousand individuals, in 2020 from 2,7 to 3,4 thousand. In the 20th century it was included in the IUCN Red List, in the Red Book of Russia, as well as in the protection documents of other countries. Hunting the snow leopard is prohibited in all countries where it inhabits, the snow leopard is also included in Appendix I of the CITES Convention (an international ban on trade in endangered species and their parts). Since 2013, 12 countries, where the snow leopard inhabits, have adopted a \"Global program for the conservation of the snow leopard and its ecosystems\", which provides for special measures for its conservation (anti-poaching, creation of special protected areas, subsidies for farmers in case of loss of livestock from the snow leopard, etc.).";
